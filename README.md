# The Conversation App by Kobe Zheng 

Built with React Native <br/>
The Conversation App provides all the tools necessary to sharpen your speaking skills. <br/>
Your virtual conversationalist peer can help you prepare for that next job interview, ace that simulated conversation task for your language final, or rehearse your witty responses for that upcoming blind date. <br/>
The setup process is easy; simply paste or type ALL the prompts you would like to practice and we will generate individual prompts for you. <br/>
The Conversation App supports two formats of simulated conversation. Choose between AUTOPLAY and TEST MODE based on your scenario! <br/>

# HOW TO USE THE APP
<b>Enter your prompts into the text input!</b> <br/>
In our situation, we want to practice answering common job interview questions. <br/>

<br/>
<b>TEST MODE removes the conversation points to holistically test you with the prompts</b> <br/>
Test yourself at your own pace by pressing the "TEST" button every time you are ready to answer a new prompt <br/>
